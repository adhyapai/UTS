# 1 Objectives, List of Stakeholders and Problem Definition 

## 1.1 Objectives

The objectives of this report will be to design a prototype to develop an information system for a major travel company and define the existing problems. This report will include a design thinking approach and an Agile Scrum methodology in order to develop this prototype. Identifying the stakeholders that are possible to clarify what kind of concerns they have. And through this project purpose, it can also define what kind of relationship is desirable. In addition, it is important to collaborate with stakeholders to provide better service for this project, so this project needs to ensure stakeholder needs and project needs.
For RUP models, the early stage of this project will use Use cases to design and analyse the prototype so that the basic structure of OO software can be built. As we use a waterfall model, there is only an opportunity to define requirements when the project starts. The Requests for this project can only be heard through requirements definition and basic design. Therefore, it takes a lot of time and effort when the specifications are changed during the project or after seeing the deliverables. Due to the number of man-hours required to redo, delivery of the final deliverable will be delayed so a use case basis builds iteration of the possible risks of large functions and important functions.

Thus, the following objectives of this report will be to:

- Identify stakeholders.
- Describe your approach from a Design Thinking principles perspective.
- Explain the agile methodology, namely, Scrum we have used to carry out the procedure.
- Describe our approach to four phases of Design Thinking principles to develop the Artefacts.
- List the assumptions we have made in the systems analysis.
- Document our proposed work products and models
- Argue                  competitive advantage
- consider the possible effects for this business as this information system project fails.

## 1.3 Problem Definition

The major travel company would like to develop their in-house call management center to provide the improved call routing and dynamic call flow control for customers so they can improve customer satisfaction and sales.

The company is still ....           

These problems include:


- During busy times, customers wait for a long time they may hang up. Without talking to the operator, the customer would have to call back multiple times. This causes an increase in the total number of calls, which leads to a vicious circle in which it is difficult to connect to the phone. For customers, when they finally get a call, they feel even more stressed, and this can cause a double or triple vicious cycle of affecting the motivation of the operator who handles the customer.
- The customer call relationship manager has a high turnover rate, and one of the reasons is that it is easy to feel stress due to customer service. That is difficult to develop excellent human resources. In such an environment, there is a chronic shortage of manpower. Inexperienced bands have to teach newcomers, and the frequency of newcomers is not well educated. It leads to a vicious circle in which the employees face the business with insufficient education and cannot make a satisfactory response, resulting in complaints.
