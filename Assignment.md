#  Objectives and Problem Definition 

1.1 Objectives

The objectives of this report will be to design a prototype to develop an information system for a major travel company and define the existing problems. This report will include a design thinking approach and an Agile Scrum methodology in order to develop this prototype. Identifying the stakeholders that are possible to clarify what kind of concerns they have. And through this project purpose, it can also define what kind of relationship is desirable. In addition, it is important to collaborate with stakeholders to provide better service for this project, so this project needs to ensure stakeholder needs and project needs.
For RUP models, the early stage of this project will use Use cases to design and analysis the prototype so that the basic structure of OO software can be built. As we use a waterfall model, there is only an opportunity to define requirements when the project starts. The Requests for this project can only be heard through requirements definition and basic design. Therefore, it takes a lot of time and effort when the specifications are changed during the project or after seeing the deliverables. Due to the number of man-hours required to redo, delivery of the final deliverable will be delayed so a use case basis builds iteration of the possible risks of large functions and important functions.

Thus, the following objectives of this report will be to:

- Identify stakeholders.
- Describe your approach from a Design Thinking principles perspective.
- Explain the agile methodology, namely, Scrum we have used to carry out the procedure.
- Describe our approach to four phases of Design Thinking principles to develop the Artefacts.
- List the assumptions we have made in the systems analysis.
- Document our proposed work products and models
- Argue                  competitive advantage
- consider the possible effects for this business as this information system project fails.

# Design Thinking approach with artefacts

Design Thinking 

Design thinking to this project is implementing the 5 phases to ensure that undefined business problems and user needs. The Systematic approach is able to meet customer value and market opportunity.


Phase1 Empathy: 

The project team will observe how the stakeholders feel. At the empathy stage, it is necessary to see things with a fresh look. It is important to gain a better understanding of how stakeholders feel about the current process and how to perform the task. Therefore, the project team conducts one-on-one or group sessions with customers. Collaborating with customers directly involved reveals a vast amount of information about their way of thinking and values that is insight. The revealed information will be written on the wall and find the relationship of information. After the session, investigate deeper and try to discover unexpected insights.
